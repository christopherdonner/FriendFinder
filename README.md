# FriendFinder

### This is a fullstack application, containing an API waiting for GET and POST requests.

### The user is prompted to complete a survey. Upon clicking the submit button the survey results are pushed to an array and in the callback following the POST is logic to iterate through the existing array and the current user's input to determing the best match result from the friends array. 

# I was unable to get the modal to work so I fell back to an alert to show the best match result.
